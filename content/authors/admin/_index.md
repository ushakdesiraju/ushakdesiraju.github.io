I am a dedicated Computer Science Lecturer and Educational Administrator with over 10 years of experience in higher education. Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of guiding and mentoring countless students in their academic journeys. I began as a lecturer and quickly rose to become the Head of the Department at Hindu University, Guntur, where I took on leadership responsibilities at an early stage in my career. Later, I founded a small institute and then joined Nalanda as a lecturer, where I proudly achieved the highest pass rate the university has ever recorded. Additionally, I served as the placements in charge, successfully placing numerous students in their professional careers.

Beyond my professional work, I am a devoted mother of two children, and I find joy in spending time nurturing plants and embracing devotional practices. I believe in the power of education to transform lives and strive to leave a positive impact on both my students and my community.
