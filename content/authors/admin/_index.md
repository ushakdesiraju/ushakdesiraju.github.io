I am a data scientist with a passion for creating innovative solutions to complex problems. I am a graduate from Shiv Nadar University, India. I majored in Computer Science Engineering with a minor in Economics.

Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist with the Global Optimization and Call Management (GOCM) team at [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/).

Previously, I was working as a research intern with the [Inria-Modal Group](https://www.inria.fr/en) to identify and isolate the causes of suicides in Nord-Pas de Calais region in France using statistical modelling and spatial econometrics. Last summer, I worked as a [Data Science for Social Good fellow](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/) at the University of Warwick in collaboration with the German Federal Minsitry for Economic Affairs (BMWK). I also dabble in Machine Learning Engineering as an open-source collaborator at the [AI4Bharat Lab at IIT-Madras](https://ai4bharat.org/). 

When I am not in front of a computer screen, I enjoy hiking to remote lands and cycling. I am always open to a match of lawn tennis or badminton. You can often find me reading Jeffrey Archer or humming to The Lumineers. I love indie and rock music ♪. You can know me better from my [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3NY2TolyTvvV8TmGrbxgRd?si=3696e704c93b4345). In my last, Myers-Briggs personality test, I tested as an [ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality).
