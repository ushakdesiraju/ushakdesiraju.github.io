        - AI4Bharat is a Research Center at IIT Madras focused on developing ML-based solutions for Indian communities. I was working as a contributor for the Shoonya Project and the Chitralekha Project. 
        
        - Shoonya is a data labeling and annotation tool built to enhance digital presence of under-represented languages in India. Chitralekha is an open source platform tool for video subtitling across various Indic languages, using ML model support. Both the platforms are currently being used by 100+ annotators across India who are skilled translation experts.

        - Developed a React and Django based web portal to annotate and store the text translations from English to Indian languages and vice-versa. 
        - Wrote efficient code for the logic of the APIs and Webhooks used by the platform for both internal and external software functionalities. 
        - Implemented multiple async functionalities in the project using celery and Django to speed up the application.

        * Worked with the highest ranked research institute in France on a problem of suicide analysis in Lille.
        * Used the socio-economic data collected from people who attempted suicide to predict whether they would attempt it again. It was also used to identify the factors which contribute to first time and repeated attempts.
        * Implemented the concepts of semi-parametric regression, statistical modelling and spatial econometrics using R.   
        * Our work determined the probability of suicide attempts in the next 6 months with an AUC Score of 0.89. This work was submitted to the local government in Lille for supporting their policy decisions in the domain of mental health support.
